[**2020Votes**](https://github.com/bill-simons/data-analysis/tree/main/2020Votes) - The division of the country into "red states" and "blue states" doesn't do justice to the diversity of opinion in all the states. For example, in the 2020 Presidential election the state in which Donald Trump received the most number of votes was California, and Joe Biden received his second-highest number of votes in Florida. After thinking about it for a second, this makes sense. In a non-landslide election each candidate is going to get the most votes from the largest states.
