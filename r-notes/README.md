[**r-notes**](https://github.com/bill-simons/data-analysis/tree/main/r-notes) - This repository contains notes about performing statitistical operation in R presented in the [Stanford Introduction to Statistical Learning in R](https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-learning) course taught by Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani.

Remembering or figuring out how to perform statistical operation in R code ia almost as hard as learning the techniques and theory behind the topics taught in the course (even if the course is light on theory -- teaching just enough to get to the interesting applications).

The files in this repository recapitulate the lab exercises, sometimes modifying the examples or adding extra notes where I encountered problems, and formatting them in the Tufte RMarkdown style with its nice margin notes.
